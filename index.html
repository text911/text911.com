					<h2>About</h2>	
					<p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/what-you-need-know-about-text-911">Texting 911</a> has been possible since 2014, but still ‚Äúmost consumers cannot reach 911 by sending a text message‚Äù, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/text-911-quick-facts-faqs">according to the FCC</a>. The major cell carriers all support it, but many of the over 6,000 local 911 centers haven‚Äôt been able to upgrade.</p>
					<p>Even worse, it‚Äôs not always easy to know if you‚Äôre one of the people who can. The rollout is covered sporadically by local news media, and the only central database is <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/9-1-1-master-psap-registry">a huge Excel spreadsheet</a>.</p>
					<p>We make that official file understandable. Just search for your city or town, and we‚Äôll let you know if your area is covered. It‚Äôs the expertise of the FCC, now easy to use. üëå</p>

					<h2>Why text-to-911 important</h2>	
					<p>First things first: <strong>The best way to reach emergency services is still to call them, even if your area supports texting 911.</strong></p>
					<p>But not everyone can call 911, especially in emergency situations. For someone who is deaf or hard of hearing, or who has a speech disability, a voice call might be difficult or unclear, and calling a video interpreter can take several minutes that the caller doesn‚Äôt have. Someone could be in a situation where a voice call would place them in further danger, like domestic abuse or a break-in. It could be as simple as not being able to speak or understand English easily.</p>
					<p>For many, texting 911 is as essential as 911 itself.</p>

					<h2>How you can help</h2>
					<p>If your area doesn‚Äôt support texting 911, advocate for change! Contact your local officials and explain why your area needs an upgrade, and how important it is. For more information, [The National Association of the Deaf](https://www.nad.org/resources/technology/access-to-911-emergency-services/) leads advocacy efforts.
